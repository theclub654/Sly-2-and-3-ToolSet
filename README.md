# Sly HD Collection ToolSet
A Bunch of tools in the making to modify the contents of Sly HD Collection for the ps3 version use visual studio to compile the files.
# Sly 2 & 3 WAL Decrypter
Drag the .WAL file from sly 2 or sly 3 on the Sly WAL Decryptor.exe and the .WAL file will decrypt you can also drag the files back on the program to encrypt it back since the algorithm is symmetric.
# Sly 2 & 3 WAL Editor
MAKE SURE YOUR .WAL FILE FOR SLY 2 AND SLY 3 IS DECRYPTED BEFORE YOU USE THIS TOOL right now the tool only supports extraction of the files and folders will try to implement replacing of the files and adding files later on also had alotta help from pavledev.
# Sly 1 WAL Editor
#As for the Sly 1 Editor make sure you have the WAC file in the same directory as the .WAL File
